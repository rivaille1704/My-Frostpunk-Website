# My-Frostpunk-Website

I created a fandom site about a game called Frostpunk.

Fandom is a website where viewers can access information about in-game objects, game guides, and join communities.

Because of the large number of fandom sites, there is actually a Frostpunk game site on Fandom.

In this project, I want to have a website with an impressive homepage, good functions, and the most authentic game reviews to help viewers have the most intuitive view of the game even if they have never played the game.

I didn't use any of the available libraries as a template to write the website. Instead, I designed each element of the website myself. This is because I wanted my project to be a mix of different design styles.

The main language I use in this project is Vietnamese.

What's cool about this site:

- I created a homepage on a black background and it was placed on a game wallpaper.
  
  Normally the wallpaper would scroll with the page so I used background-attachment: fixed; to fix the wallpaper.

- I created a light and dark toggle on the site so the site can switch back and forth between light and dark.

- I've created a Search bar to make searching easier (unfortunately I haven't created filters yet so searching will require entering the exact name of the page you're looking for)

This site has one special thing that I tried to do and that is TV
- On the navigation bar if you notice, there will be an item called "Demo", this is where the TV is located.

- This TV is capable of holding images and videos of the game. When we press the button next to the TV, the images will switch back and forth.

- I put a lot of effort into making this TV, the reasons are:
  
  - The library I used for this TV is called Swiper, which supports slide transitions. However, I wanted it to look as real as possible, so I had to rewrite the CSS myself to give it the "jump effect" on the screen when clicking the channel button.
    
  - I also designed the switch button so that when you hover over it and click and release it, it will also rotate so it looks like you are turning the knob to change channels.

I think this TV will make a big impression on viewers and help them get more interested in the game.

In the future my project may develop as follows:

 - Add Backend to your website so visitors can use login and registration functionality
 
 - Create a chat bot that can support visitors' questions (this is quite difficult for me right now)

 - Reworked the search functionality to create a site that is fluid in navigating between sites.
