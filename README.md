# My-Frostpunk-Website

I created a fandom site about a game called Frostpunk.

Fandom is a website where viewers can access information about in-game objects, game guides, and join communities.

Because of the large number of fandom sites, there is actually a Frostpunk game site on Fandom.

In this project, I want to have a website with an impressive homepage, good functions, and the most authentic game reviews to help viewers have the most intuitive view of the game even if they have never played the game.
